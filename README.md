# Project Chronos: The AI Archeologist

## Project Description

Project Chronos is an AI-powered tool designed for digital archaeologists to reconstruct fragmented digital artifacts. It leverages **Google Gemini** to piece together incomplete text from historical web pages and forums, automatically finds contextual sources, and generates comprehensive **"Reconstruction Reports."**  

The application is built with a **privacy-first, local-first approach**, allowing users to work offline while offering enhanced capabilities with optional API keys. Project Chronos aims to assist modern researchers in understanding early internet culture, slang, and communication patterns.
